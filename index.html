      <strong>"You can't write an essay on a phone." </strong>
      <!--This story is already plenty long, so I tried attempted breaking it up with these titlelines.-->
      <p> When tenth-grade students Kiara and Kayla Battle started remote learning in March 2020, their parents did not think new technology was necessary to succeed.</p>
      <p> “You’ll do fine with your phones, you don’t need a laptop, they told us,” Kayla said. “Doing all my classwork on a phone though? Not cool, not cute, not anything fun. Typing an essay on a phone? No, just no.”</p>
      <p> Many students now could find themselves in a similar situation as the Battle sisters. Since hitting a threshold of <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1329142152639733761?s=20">3% testing positivity for COVID-19</a> on November 19,
        New York City public schools shifted to all remote. </p>
      <p> While there is a plan to reopen Pre-K, 3K, K-5, and District 75 schools in early December, middle and high schoolers require devices for the long haul.</p>
      <p> Since early 2020, the Department of Education promised every NYC student would receive a device. However, the most recent numbers show that <a
          href="https://brooklyn.news12.com/nyc-schools-chancellor-students-still-without-proper-devices-for-remote-learning">60,000 students</a> still lack an iPad or Chromebook. </p>
      <p> This problem has been particularly bad in the Bronx, where one in ten households lacked a computing device in 2019.</p>

      <strong class="titleline">Earning a failing grade.</strong>
      <p>“We see that the school system, the DOE, and the city has earned a failing grade in how they’ve been able to give our children and families computers, laptops and tech assistance,” Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said in late October
        at the <a href="http://bronxboropres.nyc.gov/2020/10/27/borough-president-diaz-holds-tech-equity-day-of-action/">Tech Equality Day of Action</a>, a conference highlighting technology disparities. </p>
      <p> According to spokesperson for the DOE, Sarah Cassanovas, 40,000 LTE-enabled iPads were being shipped in November and that priority would go to students living in temporary housing, with IEPs or without internet at
        home.</p>
      <p> Kiara and Kayla, now in eleventh-grade at the Young Women’s Leadership school of the Bronx, think the iPad option is far from ideal for schoolwork. </p>
      <p> “The school only had a limited amount of laptops,” Kiara said. “After a certain point they just started giving out iPads. Which is like, fine. But for like AP Computer Science, I can’t code on an iPad. Though some students in my class
        have
        to try to code on an iPad right now.”</p>
      <p> Greg Wilkinson was frustrated by the process and ended up buying a new laptop for his daughter, a student at Health Opportunities High School. </p>
      <p> “The iPad the school sent was terrible. It had a broken cable.” Wilkinson said, “It's not enough to say I'm gonna give y'all iPads and y'all figure it
        out.” </p>

      <strong>WIFI Woes in the South Bronx.</strong>
      <p> Access to devices may be only the first step for households in the South Bronx. Currently 23% of Mott Haven and Hunts Point households are without an internet subscription of any kind, 9% more than the
        average for all of NYC.</p>
      <p> The Hunts Point based organization the Point Community Development Corporation took on this problem in 2017 with <a href="https://thepoint.org/free-hunts-point-wifi/">the Free Hunts Point WIFI project</a>. By installing portable network
        kits around the neighborhood, the Point has helped 600 people get free internet connection.</p>
      <p> The Battle sisters had enough money from two years of part time work to buy their own laptops, but connectivity issues persisted in their Mott Haven home.</p>
      <p>“I have unstable internet on like a daily basis,” Kiara said, “My parents work for Verizon, they both do, but we get no perks. We’re just regular smegular people with regular smegular internet struggling just like everyone else.”</p>
      <p>Some reason for optimism might be on the horizon as Mayor Bill de Blasio announced <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/807-20/mayor-de-blasio-holds-verizon-accountable-connect-half-million-new-york-city-households-to">new
          settlement with Verizon</a> on November 24, which will result in high-speed broadband for 500,000 additional New Yorkers. </p>
      <p> For Kiara and Kayla, the focus is just on getting through the school year.</p>
      <p>“Junior year is really hard and also really important for college,” Kayla said, “We gotta do well this year.”</p>
